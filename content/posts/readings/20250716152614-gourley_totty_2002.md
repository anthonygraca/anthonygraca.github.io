abstract = {Web technology has become the foundation for all sorts of critical networked applications and far-reaching methods of data exchange, and beneath it all is a fundamental protocol: HyperText Transfer Protocol, or HTTP. HTTP: The Definitive Guide documents everything that technical people need for using HTTP efficiently. A reader can understand how web applications work, how the core Internet protocols and architectural building blocks interact, and how to correctly implement Internet clients and servers.}

## Summary. What are the statements being made? {#summary-dot-what-are-the-statements-being-made}


## Part I. HTTP: The Web's Foundation {#part-i-dot-http-the-web-s-foundation}


### 1. Overview of HTTP {#1-dot-overview-of-http}

-   overview:
    -   How web clients and servers communicate
    -   Where resources and web content come from
    -   How web transactions work
    -   The format of the messages used for HTTP communication
    -   The underlying TCP network transport
    -   The different variations of the HTTP protocol
    -   Some of the many HTTP architectural components installed aorund the internet


#### Web Clients and Servers {#web-clients-and-servers}

-   web content lives on web servers.
-   Web servers speak the HTTP protocol
-   Clients send HTTP requests to servers, and the servers return the requested data in HTTP responses.
-   Example:
    -   A web browser is a HTTP client
    -   when you browse "<http://www.oreilly.com/index.html>", the browser sends an HTTP request to the server www.oreilly.com
    -   server tries to find the desired object, which is "/index.html"
    -   if successful, the server sends the object to the client in an HTTP response


#### Resources {#resources}

-   Web servers host web resources
    -   like a static file. could contain anything
    -   text files, HTML files, ms word files, acrobat pdf files, jpeg image files, avi movie files, or anything else
    -   can also be dynamic files based on identity or requested information. like youtube or facebook
-   a resource is any kind of content source.


#### Media Types {#media-types}

-   HTTP tags each object with a data format label called a MIME type
    -   MIME == Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions
    -   was originally used for different email systems but worked well for HTTP to describe multimedia content
-   Web clients look at the MIME type to see how it should handle the requested object
    -   Content-type: image/jpeg


#### URIs {#uris}

-   each web server resource has a name. The resource name is called a _uniform resource identifier_ or URI
    -   like the postal address of the internet
    -   {{< figure src="http://www.joes-hardware.com/specials/saw-blade.gif" >}}
-   URIs come in two flavors, URLs and URNs


#### URLs {#urls}

-   _uniform resource locator_ is the most common form of resource identifier
-   URLs follow the 3 part format:
    1.  first part is the scheme and it describes the protocol used
        -   <http://>
    2.  second part gives the server address
        -   www.joes-hardware.com
    3.  the rest names a resource on the web server
        -   /specials/saw-blade.gif
-   Almost every URI is a URL


#### Transactions {#transactions}

-   An HTTP transaction consists of a request command, sent from the client, and a response result, sent from the server
    -   Communication happens with blocks of data called _HTTP messages_


#### Methods {#methods}

-   HTTP supports several different request commands, called _HTTP methods_
    -   Every request message has a method that tells the server what action to perform
-   For example:
    -   **GET:** Send named resource from the server to the client
    -   **PUT:** Store data from client to a named server resource
    -   **DELETE:** Delete the named resource from a server
    -   **POST:** Send client data into a server gateway application
    -   **HEAD:** Send just the HTTP headers from the response for the named resource


#### Status Codes {#status-codes}

-   Every HTTP response contains a status code.
    -   3 digit code
-   For example:
    -   **200:** OK. Document returned correctly
    -   **302:** Redirect. Go someplace else to get the resource
    -   **404:** Not found. Can't find this resource


#### Web Pages can consist of multiple objects {#web-pages-can-consist-of-multiple-objects}

-   multiple HTTP transactions can be made to populate a web page.
    -   like requesting images
-   HTTP requests can be made to different servers


### 2. URLs and Resources {#2-dot-urls-and-resources}

-   URLs are the standardized names of the Internet's resources
-   This chapter is about
    -   URL syntax and what the URL components mean and do
    -   URL shortcuts
    -   URL encoding
    -   Common URL schemes
